# Pascal's Triangle
For a given integer K, print the first K rows of Pascal's Triangle. Print each row with each value separated by a single space. The value at the n<sup>th</sup> row and r<sup>th</sup> column of the triangle is equal to n!/(r! * (n-r)!) where indexing starts from 0.

##### Aditional information
- n! = 1 \* 2 \* ... \* n

##### Constraints
2 <= K <= 10

##### Sample Input
4

##### Sample Output
